# geo-scala

A core AST and utilities for GeoJSON ([RFC 7946][rfc-7946]) and more.

The project is divided in several submodules:
 - `core` contains the data model for geographical entities;
 - `circe` contains a set of [circe][circe] encoders and decoders for GeoJSON data model;
 - `polyline` contains utilities to convert GeoJSON line strings to and from [polylines][polyline].

## Quickstart

Add the following dependency in your sbt build configuration:

```scala
"com.free2move" %% "geo-scala" % "0.1.0"
```
